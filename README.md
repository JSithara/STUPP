**Project Summary**

“STUPP” is an Android application built to address the most important needs of new students. It serves as a guiding tool for studentswho 
are new to campus. It guides the students with pictures and maps which helps them to navigate around in an easier manner. It also notifies about the new and ongoing events going on campus. It helps the students to find out the list of stores and restaurants that have student friendly discounts. Although the world has lots of student apps, we believe that stupp has an edge over others as it is tailored to an environment with which we are familiar and to an audience that we know

**Minimum Features**

Mobile Application Recommender (Internet) : This is a page with a list of recommended Dalhousie mobile application as well as links to the
applications for the user.

Dalhousie Help Line List (Phone): This is a page with a list of the various Dalhousie student help agencies, their number with a feature
that allows users to call them from the application

Location (GPS, MAP) : This feature enables the user to view and navigate to various buildings, shopping centers, restaurants and 
cafeterias around the school

**Expected Functionalities**

Events (Calendar, MAP): This Feature will provide the user will a list of events going on in Dalhousie. The user will be able to 
navigate to the even and add it to their calendar

**Bonus Functionalities**

To – Do List This is a to-do list where the user can add items from the application to. The user will be able to view the items and 
check them off the list.

New Student Check List: The is a checklist feature that will contain a list of tasks for new students to perform upon entry into Dalhousie.

Weather Information (Volley) The user will be able to view weather information from the application

**Design challenges**

The team has successfully pulled off all the milestones and completed minimum, maximum and bonus features on time. It was observed 
that most of the challenges were faced on the beginning phases of the project. Initially, the team faced a problem on accommodating the 
minimalistic heuristic as the number features seemed to be high. The team came with an idea of merging on or more related features to 
make the design more meaningful and appealing. Once the design challenges were solved, the team had a smooth flow on the rest of the 
milestones. The team faced an issue on fetching data from the network in an efficient manner. To tackle this problem, the application 
used a special library named ‘Volley’. This library includes multiple operations that fetched the data from the network in a quick and 
efficient way 

**Future Work**

There is a huge scope on introducing some simple but useful functionalities on the existing features. For example, as the students are always trying to save money or spend less, the app could help the students find out the latest deals or discounts on the nearby stores or restaurants (under places). The student app could also be used on guiding students to their classrooms. Other functionalities like getting notifications on the weather or setting up reminders on the pending tasks could be also be implemented.
